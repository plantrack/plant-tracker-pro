# COMPLETE SOLUTION FOR REMOTE ACCESS

## The Problem
- Your backend API is public (via tunnel)
- But Expo Metro bundler is LOCAL only (192.168.254.71:8081)
- Your friend can't download the app code from your local network!

## SOLUTION: Use Expo Snack (Web-based)

### Option 1: Deploy to Expo Snack (EASIEST)
1. Go to https://snack.expo.dev
2. Create new Snack
3. Copy your App.js code
4. Set API_URL to your tunnel URL
5. Share the Snack link with your friend
6. They can run it instantly!

### Option 2: Publish to Expo (BEST)
```bash
# In mobile directory
npx expo publish
```
This creates a public URL your friend can open in Expo Go

### Option 3: Build a standalone APK
```bash
npx eas build --platform android --profile preview
```
Send the APK file to your friend

## Why Current Setup Fails
- Expo Go needs TWO things:
  1. ✅ Backend API (we have this via tunnel)
  2. ❌ JavaScript bundle from Metro (this is LOCAL only!)
- Your friend can't access exp://192.168.254.71:8081

## IMMEDIATE FIX

Your friend should:
1. NOT use your QR code (it points to your local network)
2. Use Expo Snack instead (see above)
3. Or wait for you to publish the app
